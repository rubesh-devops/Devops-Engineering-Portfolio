# 🧩 Git & Version Control – DevOps Portfolio

---

## 📌 Overview

This section of the DevOps Engineering Portfolio focuses on **Git and Version Control fundamentals**, which form the backbone of all modern **DevOps and CI/CD workflows**.

Git enables teams to collaborate efficiently, track changes, manage versions, and integrate development workflows with automation pipelines.  
In DevOps, Git acts as the **single source of truth** for application code, infrastructure definitions, and pipeline configurations.

---

## 🔍 Why Git is Critical in DevOps

Git plays a central role in the DevOps lifecycle by enabling:

- 🔄 Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- 👥 Collaborative development across teams
- 📜 Versioning and history tracking
- 🧪 Safe experimentation using branches
- 🚀 Automated deployments triggered by code changes

Every DevOps toolchain starts with **Git at the core**.

---

## ⚙️ Concepts Covered

This module demonstrates hands-on understanding of the following Git concepts:

- Repository creation and management
- Working directory, staging area, and commit lifecycle
- Branching strategies and merging workflows
- Remote repositories and synchronization
- Pull requests and collaborative development
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Commit history inspection and rollback concepts
- Tagging and release versioning fundamentals

---

## 🔁 Git in the DevOps Lifecycle

Git integrates seamlessly with other DevOps components:

- 🐳 **Docker** – Application source versioned in Git
- 🔁 **CI/CD Pipelines** – Builds triggered on Git commits
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** – Deployment manifests version-controlled
- 🧱 **Terraform** – Infrastructure definitions stored as code
- ⚙️ **Ansible** – Playbooks managed via Git repositories

This ensures **traceability, reproducibility, and automation** across environments.
