# 🐳 Docker Assignment 1 – Container Deployment & Web Server Setup

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on deploying a **Linux-based Docker container**, configuring a web server inside it, and exposing the service to the host machine.

The objective was to understand how Docker containers can be used to quickly deploy application environments and expose services using port mapping.

This exercise demonstrates the foundation of container-based application deployment in DevOps workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in:

- Pulling container images from a public registry
- Running containers with port mapping
- Installing services inside a running container
- Verifying application accessibility through a browser
- Understanding container isolation and networking basics

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 📦 Container Image Management
- Pulled the official Ubuntu image from Docker Hub
- Verified image availability locally
- Understood how Docker images are distributed and versioned

---

### ▶️ Container Execution & Port Mapping
- Launched a running container from the Ubuntu image
- Configured port mapping to expose container port 80 to the host machine
- Learned how Docker bridges internal container networking with the host system

---

### 🌐 Web Server Installation
- Installed Apache2 web server inside the running container
- Started and configured the service within the container environment
- Verified the service was running successfully

---

### 🔎 Service Validation
- Accessed the mapped port from the local browser
- Confirmed successful rendering of the Apache default page
- Validated container-to-host communication

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Pull → Run → Configure → Validate
- Container image usage from public registry
- Host-to-container networking via port mapping
- Rapid web server deployment inside a container

This reflects real-world DevOps container deployment practices.

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes
