# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Dockerfile Engineering & Automated Image Build Strategy

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of **Dockerfile-based image engineering** to automate container builds and eliminate manual configuration workflows.

This lab focuses on designing a declarative container build process that ensures repeatable, production-ready application packaging aligned with DevOps best practices.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Creating a structured Dockerfile  
- Automating application installation inside container  
- Injecting custom application files into image  
- Building Docker images from declarative configuration  
- Running containers from built images  
- Validating environment variable persistence  
- Verifying application deployment via browser  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured Dockerfile-based build workflow including:

- Creating dedicated project directory for container build context  
- Designing a Dockerfile defining base image and runtime setup  
- Installing required software (Apache Web Server)  
- Copying custom `index.html` into application directory  
- Defining environment variables inside Dockerfile  
- Building custom image from Dockerfile  
- Running container from built image with port mapping  
- Validating service accessibility via browser  
- Inspecting runtime environment variables inside container

# 📊 Enterprise Relevance

Dockerfile automation is critical in:

- CI/CD pipeline integration  
- Infrastructure as Code workflows  
- Cloud-native application deployments  
- Kubernetes-based orchestration environments  
- Production-grade container standardization  
- Immutable infrastructure practices  

Replacing manual container changes with Dockerfile-based builds ensures consistent, scalable, and automated application deployments.
