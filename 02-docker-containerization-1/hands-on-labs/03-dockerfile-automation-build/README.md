# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Dockerfile Automation & Custom Image Engineering

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of building custom Docker images using a **Dockerfile-based automation approach**.

This lab focuses on replacing manual container modifications with **declarative, repeatable, and production-ready image build strategies**, aligning with modern DevOps best practices.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Designing a structured Dockerfile  
- Defining base image and runtime dependencies  
- Automating application setup inside container  
- Ensuring service auto-start configuration  
- Building reusable and portable Docker images  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured Dockerfile-based image engineering including:

- Selecting appropriate base image  
- Installing required software packages  
- Configuring application runtime directory  
- Copying application code into container image  
- Defining container startup behavior  
- Building custom Docker image from Dockerfile  

---
