# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Docker CLI Operations & Container Lifecycle Governance

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of essential **Docker CLI operations** to manage containerized environments effectively.

This lab focuses on mastering container lifecycle governance, image management, runtime control, and system resource cleanup — core competencies required in modern DevOps workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Verifying Docker installation and environment readiness  
- Pulling images from centralized container registry  
- Managing Docker images locally  
- Running and monitoring containers  
- Controlling container execution lifecycle  
- Removing unused containers and images  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured execution of foundational Docker operations including:

- Validating Docker installation and version compatibility  
- Pulling official images from Docker Hub repository  
- Listing locally available Docker images  
- Launching containers from image references  
- Monitoring active and stopped containers  
- Accessing running containers using exec-based shell interaction  
- Gracefully stopping containers  
- Forcefully terminating containers when required  
- Removing stopped containers from system  
- Cleaning up unused Docker images  

This workflow ensures efficient resource management and stable container lifecycle control.
