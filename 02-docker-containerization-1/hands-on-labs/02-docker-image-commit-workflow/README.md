# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Docker Image Commit Workflow & Stateful Container Preservation

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of capturing runtime modifications made inside a running Docker container and converting them into a reusable custom image.

This lab focuses on understanding **container state persistence**, **image creation from modified containers**, and maintaining reproducible container environments for deployment reuse.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Modifying a running Docker container  
- Preserving container changes as a new image  
- Versioning custom images  
- Re-deploying containers from committed images  
- Maintaining reproducible application states  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured execution of Docker commit workflow including:

- Launching a base container  
- Installing or modifying software inside the container  
- Validating runtime configuration changes  
- Capturing container state into a new image  
- Tagging and managing image versions  
- Deploying new containers from committed image  

---

# 🔄 Workflow Execution Highlights

✔ Modified container runtime configuration  
✔ Installed additional software inside container  
✔ Verified service availability before commit  
✔ Converted modified container into reusable image  
✔ Launched new container from committed image  
✔ Validated persistence of changes

# 🧠 DevOps Skills Demonstrated

- **Docker Commit Workflow Management**
- **Container State Preservation**
- **Image Versioning Strategy**
- **Reproducible Deployment Practices**
- **Container Lifecycle Governance**
- **Runtime Environment Validation**

# 📊 Enterprise Relevance

Understanding container state preservation is critical in:

- Rapid prototyping environments  
- Debugging and troubleshooting workflows  
- Application patch testing  
- Pre-production image preparation  
- Transitioning from manual changes to automated Dockerfile workflows  

This lab builds foundational knowledge required before moving to fully automated image builds using Dockerfiles.
