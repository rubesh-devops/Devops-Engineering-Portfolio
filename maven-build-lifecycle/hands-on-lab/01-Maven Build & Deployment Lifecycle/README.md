# 📦 Hands-On – Maven Build & Deployment Lifecycle

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Implemented an end-to-end **Java application build and deployment lifecycle** using **Apache Maven**, **Git**, and **Apache Tomcat**.

This hands-on demonstrates real-world **build automation, artifact packaging, and server deployment execution**, aligning with enterprise CI/CD workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective

✔ Create a sample Maven project structure  
✔ Compile and test the application  
✔ Integrate source code using Git  
✔ Package the web application using Maven  
✔ Deploy and execute the application using Apache Tomcat  

---

## ⚙️ Execution Summary

### 1️⃣ Project Initialization

- Created a structured sample Maven project directory  
- Followed standard Maven directory conventions  
- Verified successful project setup  

This establishes the foundation for automated build workflows.

---

### 2️⃣ Compilation & Testing

- Executed Maven lifecycle phases  
- Compiled Java source files  
- Performed build validation  
- Verified successful test execution  

Ensured code integrity before packaging and deployment.

---

### 3️⃣ Source Code Integration via Git

- Installed Git version control  
- Cloned a sample web application repository  
- Integrated the application into the Maven build structure  

Simulates real enterprise development workflows where code is sourced from version control systems.

---

### 4️⃣ Application Packaging

- Executed Maven packaging lifecycle  
- Generated deployable artifact (WAR file)  
- Validated successful artifact creation  

Prepared the application for deployment in production environments.

---

### 5️⃣ Deployment on Apache Tomcat

- Installed Apache Tomcat server  
- Deployed packaged WAR artifact  
- Started Tomcat services  
- Verified successful execution through browser access  

Confirmed full build-to-deploy lifecycle completion.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Apache Maven Build Lifecycle  
- Java Project Structure Management  
- Dependency Management  
- Artifact Packaging (WAR)  
- Git Integration in Build Workflow  
- Apache Tomcat Deployment  
- End-to-End Application Delivery  

---

## 🏢 Enterprise Relevance

This implementation mirrors real-world DevOps pipelines:

- Developers commit code to Git  
- Maven compiles and packages application  
- Artifact deployed to application server  
- Application served to end users  

Demonstrates traditional Java-based CI/CD execution model.

---

## 📊 Outcome

✔ Successfully built Java web application  
✔ Generated production-ready deployable artifact  
✔ Deployed application on Tomcat server  
✔ Validated execution through browser  
✔ Demonstrated structured build automation lifecycle  

End-to-end Maven deployment lifecycle successfully implemented.
