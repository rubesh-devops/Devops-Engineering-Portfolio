# 🚀 DevOps Capstone Projects

---

## 📌 Overview

This directory contains **end-to-end DevOps lifecycle implementations** designed to simulate real-world enterprise environments.

Each capstone project demonstrates:

- Infrastructure as Code
- Configuration Management
- CI/CD Automation
- Containerization
- Kubernetes Orchestration
- Production Deployment Strategy
- Release Governance
- Cloud-Native Architecture

These projects reflect practical DevOps engineering capabilities beyond isolated tool usage.
