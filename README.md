# ⚙️ DevOps Engineering Portfolio

---

## 👋 Introduction

This repository represents my **DevOps Engineering Portfolio**, built with a strong focus on **real-world practices, automation mindset, and production-grade workflows**.

The portfolio showcases how development, operations, and cloud infrastructure come together to deliver **scalable, reliable, and secure applications**.  
All implementations are based on **hands-on labs, assignments, and capstone-style projects** completed during my DevOps learning journey.

I follow a **tool-agnostic DevOps philosophy** — understanding *why* a tool is used is as important as *how* it is used.
