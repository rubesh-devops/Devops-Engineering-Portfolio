# 🔁 Git Version Control – Branching Strategy & Workflow Management

---

## 📌 Overview

This module demonstrates structured **Git-based version control implementation**, including branching strategies, workflow management, and production release control.

The focus is on:

- Repository initialization & commit lifecycle
- Branch creation and management
- Stashing and merging workflows
- Remote repository synchronization
- GitFlow-based development strategy
- Controlled production release logic

This module reflects real-world source code management practices used in DevOps-driven development environments.

---

## 🏗 Version Control Strategy

Implemented structured Git workflows including:

- Master branch (Production-ready code)
- Develop branch (Integration environment)
- Feature branches (Isolated development)
- Public & Private branch management
- GitFlow model for structured release lifecycle

This ensures disciplined collaboration, controlled releases, and clean code history management.
