# 🧩 Git Assignment – Branch Merging, Code Propagation & Multi-Branch Synchronization

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on **advanced Git branching and merging strategies**, simulating a real-world scenario where multiple public and private branches must stay in sync with ongoing changes.

The exercise demonstrates how code changes flow across **feature branches, master branch, and restricted/private branches**, which is a common requirement in enterprise DevOps environments.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain practical understanding of:

- Managing multiple public and private branches
- Performing controlled merges into the master branch
- Propagating updated code across branches
- Maintaining consistency between feature, master, and private branches
- Handling parallel development without code divergence

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 🌿 Initial Branch & Commit Setup
- Created and committed a core file in the master branch
- Established multiple branches to represent different access levels:
  - Public feature branches
  - A restricted private branch

---

### 🔀 Feature Branch Development
- Implemented feature-specific changes in a public branch
- Staged and committed feature updates independently
- Ensured feature isolation before integration

---

### 🔗 Merging into Master
- Merged public feature branches into the master branch
- Consolidated approved changes into the main codebase
- Maintained master as the authoritative source of truth

---

### 🔐 Private Branch Updates
- Modified core files in the private branch
- Committed restricted changes separately
- Ensured sensitive changes were isolated from public branches initially

---

### 🔄 Code Synchronization Across Branches
- Updated public branches with the latest master changes
- Ensured feature branches remained compatible with the updated core code
- Propagated final consolidated code back into the private branch
- Achieved full code consistency across all branches

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Controlled feature development using public branches
- Centralized integration through the master branch
- Isolation of sensitive changes in private branches
- Bidirectional synchronization between branches
- Clean and conflict-free merge workflow

This workflow mirrors **enterprise Git branching models** used in DevOps teams.

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding complex branch merge strategies
- Managing public and private codebases
- Keeping multiple branches synchronized

---

## 🏆 Real-World Relevance

Such branching strategies are widely used in:

- Enterprise software development
- DevOps teams with role-based access
- Feature gating and staged releases
- Secure code management workflows
- CI/CD pipelines with multiple environments

---
