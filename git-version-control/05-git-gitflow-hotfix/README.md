# 🧩 Git Assignment – Git Flow Workflow & Hotfix Management

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing the **Git Flow workflow architecture**, a widely adopted branching model used in professional DevOps and software development teams.

The exercise demonstrates how structured branching strategies help manage **feature development, releases, and urgent production fixes** in a controlled and predictable manner.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain practical understanding of:

- Git Flow branching architecture
- Role of different branches in a release lifecycle
- Controlled promotion of code from feature to production
- Handling urgent fixes using hotfix branches
- Maintaining stability of the master branch

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 🌿 Git Flow Architecture Setup
- Designed a Git repository following the Git Flow model
- Created all required branches to represent:
  - Stable production code
  - Ongoing development
  - Feature-specific work
  - Emergency fixes

---

### 🚀 Feature Development Workflow
- Started development from a feature branch
- Followed the Git Flow promotion path
- Integrated completed feature work into the main codebase
- Ensured controlled and structured code movement

---

### 🔥 Hotfix Handling
- Simulated an urgent production issue
- Used a dedicated hotfix branch to apply the fix
- Updated the master branch directly with the hotfix
- Demonstrated rapid response to critical issues without disrupting ongoing development

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Structured Git Flow branching model
- Separation of development, feature, and production code
- Safe and predictable code promotion
- Emergency fix handling using hotfix branches
- Production stability preservation

This workflow reflects **industry-standard DevOps release management practices**.
