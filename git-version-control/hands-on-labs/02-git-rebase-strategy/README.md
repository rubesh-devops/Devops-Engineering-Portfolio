# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Git Rebase Workflow & Commit History Optimization

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of **Git Rebase operations** to maintain a clean, linear commit history and improve branch synchronization workflows.

This lab focuses on mastering rebase-based integration strategies used in professional DevOps environments to eliminate unnecessary merge commits and enhance repository readability.

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Rebasing local feature branches  
- Synchronizing branches with updated base branch  
- Inspecting commit history before and after rebase  
- Maintaining linear commit structure  
- Improving branch hygiene  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured rebase workflow including:

- Switching to local feature branch  
- Rebasing branch onto updated base branch  
- Reviewing commit history using log inspection  
- Validating linear commit alignment  
- Ensuring repository stability post-rebase  

This workflow ensures structured branch synchronization without polluting commit history.
