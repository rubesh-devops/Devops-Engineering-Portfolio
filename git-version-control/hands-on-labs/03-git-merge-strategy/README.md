# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Git Merge Strategy & Branch Integration Governance

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of **Git Merge operations** to integrate feature branches into the main codebase while maintaining repository integrity.

This lab focuses on mastering merge workflows used in enterprise DevOps environments to safely combine parallel development efforts and maintain controlled release governance.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Merging feature branches into integration branches  
- Managing fast-forward and non-fast-forward merges  
- Handling merge conflicts  
- Preserving commit history integrity  
- Validating code consistency post-merge  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured execution of merge-based workflows including:

- Creating independent feature branches  
- Introducing divergent changes  
- Executing branch merges into master/develop  
- Handling manual merge conflict resolution  
- Validating commit history post-integration  
- Ensuring stable branch synchronization  

---
