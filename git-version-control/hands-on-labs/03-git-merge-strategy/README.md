# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Git Merge Strategy & Branch Integration Governance

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of **Git Merge operations** to integrate parallel development branches into a unified codebase while maintaining repository stability.

This lab focuses on mastering merge-based integration strategies used in enterprise DevOps environments to safely combine feature development with production-ready branches.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Merging source branches into target branches  
- Validating branch integration workflow  
- Inspecting commit history after merge  
- Maintaining repository integrity  
- Ensuring stable integration into master branch  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured branch integration workflow including:

- Creating and updating feature branches  
- Executing merge from source branch into target branch  
- Reviewing merge results  
- Inspecting commit history using log analysis  
- Validating commit graph structure post-merge  
- Ensuring no unintended code conflicts  

This workflow simulates real-world collaborative branch integration scenarios.
