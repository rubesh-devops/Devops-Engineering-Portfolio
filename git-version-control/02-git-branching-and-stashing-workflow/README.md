# 🧩 Git Assignment – Branching, Stashing & Workflow Management

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on **advanced Git workflow concepts** used in real-world DevOps and development environments.  
The objective was to understand how **branches, stashing, and context switching** help developers manage parallel workstreams without losing progress.

This exercise simulates a **multi-branch development workflow**, which is a core practice in modern DevOps teams.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in:

- Creating and managing multiple Git branches
- Handling unfinished work safely using Git stash
- Switching between branches without data loss
- Maintaining clean and organized commit history
- Understanding real-world branching strategies

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 🌿 Repository & Branch Setup
- Initialized a Git working directory on the master branch
- Created initial feature files to simulate baseline code
- Established multiple branches to represent parallel development tracks

---

### 🔀 Branching Strategy
- Created separate branches for:
  - Development integration
  - Individual feature work
- Followed a structured branching approach similar to **Git Flow**

---

### 📦 Stashing Uncommitted Work
- Created changes in the develop branch without staging or committing
- Used Git stash to temporarily store unfinished work
- Safely switched branches while preserving in-progress changes

---

### ✨ Feature Development
- Implemented feature-specific changes in the feature branch
- Staged and committed completed work independently
- Ensured feature isolation without impacting other branches

---

### 🔄 Restoring & Finalizing Work
- Returned to the develop branch
- Restored previously stashed changes
- Committed the restored work cleanly into the branch

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Parallel development using multiple branches
- Safe interruption and resumption of work using stashing
- Clean separation of feature and development work
- Controlled commit flow across branches

This workflow mirrors **real DevOps and agile team practices**.

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Git branching models
- Safe handling of uncommitted changes
- Effective use of Git stash in development workflows
- Managing parallel tasks without conflicts
- Improved confidence in multi-branch Git operations

---

## 🏆 Real-World Relevance

These Git practices are widely used in:

- Agile software development teams
- DevOps CI/CD workflows
- Feature-based development models
- Release and hotfix management
- Collaborative engineering environments

Mastering these concepts is essential for working in **production DevOps teams**.

---
