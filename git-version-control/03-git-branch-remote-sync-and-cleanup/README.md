# 🧩 Git Assignment – Branch Management, Remote Sync & Branch Deletion

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on **branch lifecycle management in Git**, covering the creation, usage, synchronization, and deletion of branches across **local and remote repositories**.

The exercise reflects real-world DevOps practices where branches are created for development and features, pushed to remote repositories for collaboration, and deleted once no longer required.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in:

- Managing multiple branches in a Git repository
- Isolating work across branches
- Synchronizing local branches with GitHub
- Cleaning up obsolete branches both locally and remotely
- Understanding branch lifecycle in collaborative workflows

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 🌿 Repository & Branch Initialization
- Created a Git working directory
- Established multiple branches to represent development and feature work
- Ensured a structured branching environment

---

### 📝 Branch-Specific Development
- Added and committed a main file in the master branch
- Created separate files in each branch to simulate independent workstreams:
  - Development branch changes
  - Feature-specific changes in individual branches
- Maintained isolation between branches to avoid conflicts

---

### 🌐 Remote Repository Synchronization
- Pushed all local branches to GitHub
- Ensured remote visibility of all development and feature branches
- Verified branch consistency between local and remote repositories

---

### 🧹 Branch Cleanup & Maintenance
- Deleted an obsolete feature branch from the local repository
- Removed the same branch from the remote GitHub repository
- Demonstrated repository hygiene and lifecycle management

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Multi-branch development workflow
- Independent feature and development streams
- Local-to-remote synchronization
- Safe deletion of unused branches
- Clean and maintainable repository management

This workflow is essential in **DevOps-driven CI/CD environments**.

---
