# 🧩 Git Assignment – Repository Creation, Staging, Commit & Push

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on **foundational Git operations** that form the basis of all DevOps and CI/CD workflows.  
The objective was to understand how local files are tracked, staged, committed, and finally pushed to a **remote GitHub repository**.

This exercise demonstrates the complete **local-to-remote Git workflow**, which is essential for collaborative development and automation pipelines.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on understanding of:

- Creating and organizing files locally
- Tracking changes using Git
- Selective staging of files
- Committing changes with meaningful history
- Publishing code to a remote GitHub repository

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown

### 📁 Folder & File Management
- Created a new project folder
- Added the following files:
  - `Code.txt`
  - `Log.txt`
  - `Output.txt`

---

### 📌 Staging Strategy
- Selected specific files for staging:
  - `Code.txt`
  - `Output.txt`
- Demonstrated **selective staging**, a key Git concept
- Left `Log.txt` unstaged to understand file tracking behavior

---

### 📝 Commit Process
- Committed only the staged files
- Maintained a clean and intentional commit history
- Understood the importance of meaningful commits in team environments

---

### 🌐 Remote Repository Integration
- Connected the local repository to GitHub
- Pushed committed changes to the remote repository
- Verified successful synchronization between local and remote repositories

---

## 🔁 Git Workflow Demonstrated

This assignment covers the complete Git lifecycle:

- Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository
- Change tracking and version history
- Separation of local development and centralized collaboration

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Git repository initialization
- Differentiating between tracked, staged, and committed files
