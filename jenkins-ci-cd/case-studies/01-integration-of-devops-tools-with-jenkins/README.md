# 🚀 Case Study – Integration of DevOps Tools with Jenkins

---

## 📌 Business Scenario

Hired as a DevOps Engineer to implement a complete CI/CD lifecycle by integrating multiple DevOps tools with Jenkins for automated build, containerization, and deployment.

The organization required a scalable automation pipeline capable of handling version control, build automation, containerization, and controlled production publishing.

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a CI/CD pipeline integrating multiple DevOps tools that:

- Implements structured Git workflow
- Triggers automated builds on commit
- Uses Docker for containerized build environments
- Publishes application selectively based on branch
- Automates release management
- Ensures controlled production deployment

---

# 🏗 DevOps Toolchain Integrated

The following tools were integrated with Jenkins:

- Git (Version Control)
- Git Webhooks (Trigger Mechanism)
- Jenkins (CI/CD Orchestrator)
- Docker (Containerized Build Environment)
- Apache (Application Hosting)

---
