# 🚀 Jenkins – Git-Triggered CI Pipeline Implementation

---

## 📌 Overview

Designed and implemented an automated CI pipeline using Jenkins that triggers on code push events to the **develop branch**.

The pipeline is configured to automatically fetch updated source code from Git and deploy it into a designated workspace directory.

This assignment demonstrates event-driven CI automation and source code synchronization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a continuous integration workflow that:

- Listens for Git push events on the develop branch
- Automatically triggers Jenkins pipeline
- Pulls updated source code from Git repository
- Deploys content into a defined directory
- Eliminates manual build triggering

---

# 🏗 Architecture Implemented

CI/CD Components:

- Jenkins Server
- Git Repository
- Webhook-based trigger
- Jenkins Pipeline
- Workspace deployment directory

Workflow:

Git Push (develop branch)  
⬇  
Webhook Trigger  
⬇  
Jenkins Pipeline Execution  
⬇  
Code Pull to Target Directory

# 🔄 Implementation Executed

✔ Configured Jenkins pipeline job  
✔ Integrated Git repository with Jenkins  
✔ Enabled webhook trigger for develop branch  
✔ Defined pipeline logic to fetch repository content  
✔ Configured workspace directory for code deployment  
✔ Verified automated pipeline execution on push  

Result:

- Push to develop branch automatically triggered build  
- Source code pulled successfully to configured folder  
- No manual intervention required  
- Continuous integration successfully implemented
