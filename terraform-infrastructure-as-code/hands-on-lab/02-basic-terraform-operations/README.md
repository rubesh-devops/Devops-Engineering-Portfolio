# 🛠 Hands-On 2 – Basic Terraform Operations

---

## 📌 Overview

In this hands-on, I executed the **core Terraform workflow commands** to provision infrastructure on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

This practical exercise focused on understanding the lifecycle of Terraform operations — from initialization to validation — while deploying an EC2 instance in AWS.

---

# 🎯 Objective

✔ Initialize Terraform working directory  
✔ Generate infrastructure execution plan  
✔ Provision AWS EC2 instance using Terraform  
✔ Validate configuration syntax  
✔ Inspect infrastructure state  

---

# ⚙️ Terraform Workflow Executed

## 🔹 1️⃣ terraform init – Initialization

✔ Initialized Terraform working directory  
✔ Downloaded required AWS provider plugins  
✔ Created `.terraform` directory  
✔ Prepared environment for infrastructure provisioning  

**Purpose:**  
Ensures all required provider dependencies are installed before execution.

---

## 🔹 2️⃣ terraform plan – Execution Planning

✔ Generated execution plan  
✔ Reviewed resource creation details (EC2 instance, AMI, instance type)  
✔ Validated planned infrastructure changes before applying  

**Purpose:**  
Provides preview of infrastructure changes without modifying live resources.

---

## 🔹 3️⃣ terraform apply – Infrastructure Deployment

✔ Applied planned changes  
✔ Provisioned EC2 instance in AWS  
✔ Updated Terraform state file  

**Purpose:**  
Creates real infrastructure resources in the cloud.

---

## 🔹 4️⃣ terraform show – State Inspection

✔ Displayed full resource configuration  
✔ Verified instance details  
✔ Confirmed resource attributes  

**Purpose:**  
Provides visibility into the current Terraform-managed infrastructure.

---

## 🔹 5️⃣ terraform validate – Configuration Validation

✔ Verified configuration syntax  
✔ Ensured attribute correctness  
✔ Confirmed structural integrity of Terraform files  

**Purpose:**  
Prevents deployment failures due to misconfigurations.
