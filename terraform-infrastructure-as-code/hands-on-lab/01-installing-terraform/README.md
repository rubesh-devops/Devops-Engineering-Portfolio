# 🛠 Hands-On 1 – Installing Terraform

---

## 📌 Overview

In this hands-on, I installed and configured **Terraform** on both Windows and Ubuntu environments to enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) execution across platforms.

This setup forms the foundation for provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform in later assignments and case studies.
