# 🌍 Terraform – EC2 Provisioning in Ohio Region (Default Subnet)

---

## 📌 Overview

Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision an EC2 instance in the **AWS Ohio (us-east-2) region** within the default VPC and subnet.

This assignment demonstrates foundational Terraform provisioning, provider configuration, and automated cloud resource deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Automate EC2 provisioning by:

- Configuring AWS provider for Ohio region
- Deploying EC2 instance in default subnet
- Eliminating manual AWS Console provisioning
- Managing infrastructure declaratively
- Validating Terraform state tracking

---

# 🏗 Infrastructure Architecture

Provisioned Resource:

- 1 EC2 Instance
- Region: Ohio (us-east-2)
- Default VPC
- Default Subnet
- Security Group attached (default or configured)
