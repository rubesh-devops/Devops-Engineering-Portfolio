# 📊 ELK Observability Stack
## Centralized Logging & Real-Time Monitoring

## 📘 Module Overview

This module demonstrates hands-on implementation of a centralized logging architecture using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

The objective was to design and deploy a logging solution capable of aggregating logs from distributed systems, processing and transforming logs, storing logs efficiently, and visualizing logs through dashboards for real-time monitoring.

This module strengthens the Monitoring and Observability layer of the DevOps lifecycle.

## 🧱 Tools & Technologies Used

- Elasticsearch – Distributed search and analytics engine  
- Logstash – Log processing and transformation pipeline  
- Kibana – Visualization and dashboard layer  
- Linux (Ubuntu / AWS EC2)  
- Docker (where applicable)  

## 🎯 Key Objectives Achieved

- Installed and configured ELK stack  
- Centralized log collection from servers and applications  
- Parsed and structured logs using Logstash  
- Indexed logs into Elasticsearch  
- Created Kibana dashboards for visualization  
- Enabled real-time log monitoring  
- Improved debugging and operational visibility  

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

Application or Server Logs  
⬇  
Logstash (Processing and Filtering)  
⬇  
Elasticsearch (Indexing and Storage)  
⬇  
Kibana (Visualization and Dashboarding)  

This setup enables real-time log monitoring, production troubleshooting, performance insights, incident investigation, and scalable logging infrastructure.

## 🧠 DevOps Skills Demonstrated

- Centralized Logging Architecture Design  
- Log Parsing and Filtering  
- Distributed Data Storage  
- Real-Time Monitoring  
- Kibana Dashboard Creation
