# 📦 Assignment – Puppet Master-Agent Setup & Apache Automation

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

Designed and implemented a **Puppet Master-Agent architecture** using three nodes to automate web server provisioning across managed infrastructure.

This assignment demonstrates centralized configuration management and declarative automation using Puppet manifests.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a Puppet-based configuration management environment that:

- Establishes secure Master-Agent communication  
- Implements certificate-based authentication  
- Automates Apache installation on managed nodes  
- Enforces desired state configuration  
- Eliminates manual server provisioning  

---

# 🏗 Architecture Design

Implemented a 3-node infrastructure consisting of:

- **1 Puppet Master (Control Node)**
- **2 Puppet Agents (Managed Nodes)**

Architecture characteristics:

- SSL certificate-based authentication  
- Centralized manifest management  
- Agent pull-based configuration enforcement  
- Declarative infrastructure modeling  

This architecture mirrors enterprise-scale configuration governance.

# 🔄 Implementation Strategy

---

## 🔹 Puppet Master-Agent Setup

Configured Puppet infrastructure to:

- Install Puppet on all nodes  
- Configure master and agent roles  
- Establish secure certificate exchange  
- Enable agent-to-master communication  
- Validate node registration  

This ensures controlled configuration distribution.

---

## 🔹 Apache Installation via Manifests

Developed Puppet manifests to:

- Declare Apache package resource  
- Ensure installation state enforcement  
- Manage Apache service lifecycle  
- Enable service auto-start  
- Maintain idempotent execution  

Puppet ensures Apache remains installed even after repeated runs.
