# 📦 Puppet – Master-Agent Setup & Apache Configuration Management

---

## 📌 Overview

Designed and implemented a Puppet Master–Agent architecture to centrally manage infrastructure configuration across multiple nodes.

Configured a 3-node Puppet environment and automated Apache installation on agent nodes using declarative Puppet manifests.

This assignment establishes the foundational configuration management architecture for scalable infrastructure automation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement centralized configuration management by:

- Setting up Puppet Master–Agent architecture
- Establishing secure node communication
- Deploying Apache on multiple agents using manifests
- Enforcing consistent server configuration across nodes

---

# 🏗 Infrastructure Architecture

Environment Setup:

- 1 Puppet Master
- 2 Puppet Agents (Slaves)
- Secure certificate-based authentication between Master and Agents

Configuration Goal:

- Install and manage Apache service on all slave nodes
- Ensure consistent web server configuration via Puppet manifests

---

# 🔄 Implementation Executed

✔ Installed Puppet Master and configured service  
✔ Installed Puppet Agents on slave nodes  
✔ Configured certificate signing between Master and Agents  
✔ Created and deployed Puppet manifests  
✔ Automated Apache installation across agents  
✔ Verified service installation and status consistency  

Result:

- Centralized configuration control established  
- Apache successfully deployed on all slave nodes  
- Configuration enforced idempotently
