# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Conditional Execution using "onlyif" in Puppet

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Implemented conditional execution logic in Puppet using the **"onlyif"** attribute to control resource execution based on system state.

This lab demonstrates how to enforce intelligent configuration management where tasks execute only when specific conditions are satisfied.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Enhance Puppet automation by:

- Introducing conditional execution control
- Preventing unnecessary configuration runs
- Ensuring state-based service installation
- Improving infrastructure efficiency

---

# 🏗 Infrastructure Context

Environment:

- 1 Puppet Master
- 1 Puppet Agent
- Production environment manifest directory used

Automation Goal:

- Apply MySQL installation conditionally
- Execute resource only if predefined condition is met
- Validate service status post deployment

---

# 🔄 Implementation Executed

✔ Navigated to production manifest directory  
✔ Updated Puppet manifest to include **onlyif** condition  
✔ Applied conditional logic to MySQL service installation  
✔ Triggered Puppet agent run for enforcement  
✔ Verified MySQL service status on agent  
✔ Confirmed browser-level service validation  

Result:

- MySQL installed only when condition satisfied  
- No redundant installation attempts  
- Configuration remained idempotent  
- Infrastructure behaved predictably
