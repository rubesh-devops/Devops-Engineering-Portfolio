# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Manifest-Based Service Deployment using Puppet

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Designed and deployed a Puppet manifest to automate service installation and file resource management on a Puppet Agent.

This lab demonstrates declarative infrastructure provisioning using Puppet manifests within the production environment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Implement configuration automation by:

- Creating a manifest inside the production environment
- Installing and managing a web service
- Deploying a status file for validation
- Enforcing idempotent configuration state on agent nodes

---

# 🏗 Infrastructure Context

Environment:

- 1 Puppet Master
- 1 Puppet Agent
- Production environment manifest directory

Automation Goal:

- Install and manage web service
- Deploy `/tmp/status.txt`
- Validate service accessibility via browser
- Ensure configuration consistency

---

# 🔄 Implementation Executed

✔ Navigated to production manifest directory  
✔ Created Puppet manifest for service deployment  
✔ Defined package, service, and file resources  
✔ Triggered Puppet agent run for configuration enforcement  
✔ Verified service accessibility via browser  
✔ Confirmed file creation at `/tmp/status.txt`  

Result:

- Web service successfully installed and running  
- Status file deployed on agent  
- Configuration enforced idempotently  
- Infrastructure remained consistent on repeated runs
