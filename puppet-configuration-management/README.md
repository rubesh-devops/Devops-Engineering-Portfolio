## 📌 Module Overview

This module demonstrates hands-on implementation of **Puppet-based Infrastructure Automation and Configuration Management** in distributed environments.

The focus of this module is to design, deploy, and manage scalable infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles with Puppet.

The implementations simulate real-world enterprise scenarios including:

- Centralized configuration governance  
- Automated software provisioning  
- Declarative infrastructure management  
- Node classification and grouping  
- Scalable configuration enforcement  

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build and manage a Puppet-based automation architecture that:

- Eliminates manual server configuration  
- Enforces desired state configuration  
- Automates application and service deployments  
- Supports role-based infrastructure modeling  
- Enables scalable configuration management  

---

# 🏗 Puppet Architecture Implemented

Implemented Puppet-based automation environment including:

- **Puppet Master (Control Node)**
- **Puppet Agents (Managed Nodes)**
- Manifest-based configuration enforcement
- Module-based configuration structuring
- Role-based infrastructure modeling
- Automated service lifecycle control

This architecture reflects enterprise-grade configuration management practices.
