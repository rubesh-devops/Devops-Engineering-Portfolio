# 🐳 Docker – Containerization Fundamentals (DevOps Portfolio)

---

## 📌 Module Overview

This module focuses on **Docker and containerization**, one of the core building blocks of modern **DevOps and cloud-native application delivery**.

Docker enables applications to be packaged along with their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, ensuring **consistency across development, testing, and production environments**.  
This module demonstrates an understanding of how containerization simplifies deployment, scaling, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and apply:

- Containerization concepts and benefits
- Docker architecture and components
- Building and managing container images
- Running and managing containers
- Preparing applications for orchestration platforms like Kubernetes

---

## 🧠 Why Docker is Important in DevOps

Docker plays a critical role in DevOps by enabling:

- 📦 Consistent application environments
- 🚀 Faster deployments
- 🔁 Seamless CI/CD integration
- ☁️ Cloud portability
- ⚙️ Microservices-based architectures

Containers remove the “works on my machine” problem and form the foundation of **modern DevOps pipelines**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Concepts Covered

This module covers the following Docker fundamentals:

- Docker engine and container runtime
- Images, containers, and registries
- Dockerfile concepts
- Image versioning and tagging
- Container lifecycle management
- Basic container networking and storage concepts
- Interaction with public container registries

---

## 🔁 Docker in the DevOps Lifecycle

Docker integrates tightly with other DevOps tools and practices:

- 🔧 **Git** – Source code versioning for container builds
- 🔁 **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automated image builds and deployments
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration and scaling
- 🧱 **Infrastructure as Code** – Provisioning container-ready infrastructure
- ☁️ **Cloud Platforms** – Running containerized workloads at scale

This makes Docker a **central pillar of DevOps workflows**.
