# ⚙️ Ansible – Role-Based Service Deployment

---

## 📌 Implementation Overview

Designed and implemented **role-based automation** using Ansible to provision different web servers on separate managed nodes.

Created structured Ansible Roles to install **Apache2 on one host** and **NGINX on another**, demonstrating modular, reusable, and scalable configuration management practices.

This implementation reflects enterprise-level infrastructure automation using structured role separation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To implement modular automation using **Ansible Roles**, enabling clean separation of configuration logic and scalable multi-service deployments across infrastructure.

---

## 🗂 Implementation Summary

- Designed two independent Ansible Roles:
  - Role 1 → Apache2 deployment
  - Role 2 → NGINX deployment
- Structured role directories following Ansible best practices
- Targeted different managed nodes using inventory grouping
- Executed Playbook to provision services on respective hosts
- Validated successful installation and service activation

This approach ensures clean architecture and reusable automation components.

---

## 🔁 Automation Architecture
