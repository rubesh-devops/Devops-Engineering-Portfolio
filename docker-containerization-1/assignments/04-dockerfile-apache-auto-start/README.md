# 🐳 Docker Assignment 4 – Dockerfile Creation & Automated Service Startup

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on creating a **Dockerfile** to build a custom Docker image with predefined configurations.

The objective was to define a reproducible container build process where:
- Ubuntu is used as the base image
- Apache2 is installed automatically
- Apache2 starts automatically when the container launches

This assignment introduces the concept of **Infrastructure as Code for containers**, where application environments are defined declaratively.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in:

- Writing a Dockerfile
- Defining container build instructions
- Automating software installation during image build
- Configuring services to start automatically at runtime
- Creating reproducible and portable container environments

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 🧱 Base Image Selection
- Selected Ubuntu as the foundational operating system
- Established a consistent and lightweight container base

---

### 📦 Automated Package Installation
- Defined instructions to install Apache2 during the image build process
- Eliminated the need for manual configuration after container startup
- Ensured repeatability of the environment

---

### ▶️ Service Auto-Startup Configuration
- Configured the container so Apache2 starts automatically when the container runs
- Ensured immediate service availability without manual intervention
- Applied best practices for container entry point behavior

---

### 🔄 Image Reusability
- Created a fully self-contained image
- Enabled consistent deployments across multiple environments
- Demonstrated automation-first DevOps practices

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Dockerfile definition
- Image build automation
- Service auto-start configuration
- Containerized web server deployment
- Repeatable environment creation

This reflects production-grade container build practices.

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Dockerfile structure and instructions
- Automating container image builds
- Defining container runtime behavior
- Eliminating manual configuration steps
- Preparing containers for CI/CD integration

---

## 🏆 Real-World Relevance

Dockerfiles are fundamental in:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Microservices deployments
- Cloud-native platforms
- Infrastructure as Code practices
- Scalable container orchestration systems

Every production container environment relies on properly defined Dockerfiles.
