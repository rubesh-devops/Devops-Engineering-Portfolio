# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Docker Container Commit Workflow & Image Version Preservation

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Executed structured implementation of capturing runtime modifications made inside a running Docker container and converting them into a reusable custom image.

This lab focuses on understanding **container state persistence**, **image commit workflows**, and preparing customized runtime environments for reuse across deployments.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate hands-on proficiency in:

- Pulling and launching base Docker containers  
- Accessing container runtime environment  
- Installing additional software inside running container  
- Preserving container state as a new image  
- Tagging image for Docker Hub compatibility  
- Preparing committed image for registry publishing  

---

# 🛠 Practical Implementation Scope

Performed structured container modification and image commit workflow including:

- Pulling official base image from Docker Hub  
- Launching container instance from base image  
- Accessing container shell environment  
- Installing Apache web server within running container  
- Validating service installation  
- Exiting container runtime safely  
- Committing container changes into a new reusable Docker image  
- Tagging image using Docker Hub naming convention  

This workflow demonstrates transitioning from runtime modifications to reusable image artifacts.

# 🧠 DevOps Skills Demonstrated

- **Container Runtime Modification**
- **Docker Commit Workflow Management**
- **Image Versioning Strategy**
- **Artifact Preparation for Registry Publishing**
- **Container State Preservation**
- **Manual-to-Automated Build Transition Awareness**

---

# 📊 Enterprise Relevance

Understanding container commit workflows is important for:

- Rapid prototyping environments  
- Debugging and environment replication  
- Testing production patches  
- Preparing images before automating via Dockerfile  
- Transitioning legacy manual configurations into containerized workflows  

Although Dockerfile-based builds are preferred for production, commit workflows help in quick environment preservation and debugging scenarios.
