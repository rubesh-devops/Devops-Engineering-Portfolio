# 🐳 Docker Containerization – Application Packaging & Image Lifecycle Management

---

## 📌 Overview

This module demonstrates **application containerization, image lifecycle management, and Docker-based deployment automation**.

The implementation focuses on:

- Building custom Docker images
- Managing container runtime environments
- Publishing images to Docker Hub
- Reusing images across environments
- Automating web server deployment inside containers

This module reflects real-world containerization workflows used in modern DevOps pipelines.

---

## 🏗 Containerization Strategy

- Base image selection and customization
- Dockerfile-driven image creation
- Service automation inside containers
- Image versioning and reuse
- Cross-machine container deployment
- Browser-based service validation

The objective is to build portable, consistent, and scalable application environments.
