# 🧪 Hands-On Lab – Kubernetes Observability Visualization using Grafana

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Implemented **Grafana-based visualization layer** integrated with Prometheus monitoring inside a Kubernetes cluster.

This lab demonstrates how enterprise DevOps environments transform raw metrics into actionable dashboards using cloud-native observability tools.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design and deploy a monitoring visualization architecture that:

- Integrates Grafana with Prometheus data source  
- Enables real-time cluster metrics visualization  
- Provides customizable dashboards  
- Exposes monitoring interface securely  
- Strengthens observability-driven operations  

---

# 🏗 Observability Architecture Enhancement

Extended existing monitoring stack by adding:

- Grafana Deployment  
- Prometheus Data Source Configuration  
- ConfigMap-based dynamic configuration  
- Kubernetes Service for dashboard exposure  
- Secure namespace-based deployment  

Architecture now consists of:

- Prometheus → Metrics Collection  
- Grafana → Metrics Visualization  
- Kubernetes → Workload Orchestration  

This reflects modern cloud-native monitoring design.

# 🔄 Implementation Strategy

---

## 🔹 Data Source Configuration

Configured Grafana to:

- Connect to Prometheus service  
- Use Prometheus as metrics backend  
- Automatically load data source settings  
- Enable dynamic query-based visualization  

This establishes seamless monitoring pipeline.

---

## 🔹 Grafana Deployment

Deployed Grafana as:

- Containerized application  
- Managed Kubernetes workload  
- Integrated with Prometheus backend  
- Scalable and resilient dashboard service  

Deployment ensures availability of visualization layer.

---

## 🔹 Service Exposure

Exposed Grafana dashboard using Kubernetes Service to:

- Allow browser-based access  
- Provide cluster-level visibility  
- Enable monitoring access via IP or DNS  
- Simulate production-grade observability endpoint  

---

## 🔹 Metrics Visualization & Validation

Validated observability integration by:

- Accessing Grafana dashboard  
- Verifying Prometheus connection  
- Confirming cluster metrics availability  
- Monitoring resource utilization dashboards  

This confirms successful monitoring pipeline.
