# ⚙️ Ansible Assignment – Multi-Node Configuration Management with Playbooks

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing **Configuration Management using Ansible** in a multi-node environment.

The objective was to set up an **Ansible control node** and manage multiple target nodes (slaves) using **Ansible Playbooks**, automating the installation of different services on separate machines.

This demonstrates real-world DevOps automation where infrastructure configuration is managed declaratively.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain hands-on experience in:

- Setting up an **Ansible cluster architecture**
- Configuring a control node and multiple managed nodes
- Writing and executing **Ansible Playbooks**
- Installing software on remote systems using automation
- Managing role-based service deployment across nodes

---

## 🗂 Task Breakdown / Implementation Overview

### 🖥 Ansible Cluster Setup

- Configured one machine as the **Ansible Control Node**
- Connected two managed nodes (Slave 1 and Slave 2)
- Established secure communication between control and managed nodes
- Verified connectivity using Ansible inventory

This reflects real-world **infrastructure orchestration architecture**.

---

### ☕ Service Deployment – Java Installation

- Created a Playbook to install **Java** on Slave 1
- Ensured the configuration was applied only to the targeted node
- Verified successful installation using automated task execution

This demonstrates **target-specific automation using inventory grouping**.

---

### 🗄 Service Deployment – MySQL Installation

- Created a Playbook to install **MySQL Server** on Slave 2
- Applied configuration via declarative automation
- Validated successful service deployment

This reflects **role-based service configuration management**.

---

### 🔄 Infrastructure as Code Approach

- Used Playbooks to define configuration in a repeatable manner
- Eliminated manual setup steps
- Enabled consistent and idempotent execution

This aligns with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles** in DevOps.

---

## 🔁 Workflow Demonstrated

- Control Node → Managed Nodes architecture  
- Inventory-based host grouping  
- Playbook-driven configuration  
- Targeted service installation  
- Automated validation  

This mirrors enterprise DevOps automation workflows.

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding Ansible architecture
- Writing structured and reusable Playbooks
