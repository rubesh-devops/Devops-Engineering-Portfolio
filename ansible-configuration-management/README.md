# ⚙️ Ansible – Configuration Management & Infrastructure Automation

---

## 📌 Module Overview

This module focuses on **Ansible-based Configuration Management**, a critical component of modern DevOps automation.

Ansible enables infrastructure and application environments to be managed in a **declarative, repeatable, and scalable manner**.  
Using Ansible Playbooks, system configurations can be automated across multiple servers without manual intervention.

This module demonstrates how infrastructure is treated as **code**, ensuring consistency across environments.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement:

- **Ansible architecture (Control Node & Managed Nodes)**
- **Inventory-based host management**
- **Playbook-driven automation**
- **Service installation and configuration automation**
- **Idempotent infrastructure management**

---

## 🧠 Why Ansible is Important in DevOps

Ansible plays a central role in DevOps by enabling:

- ⚙️ Automated server configuration
- 🔁 Repeatable environment setup
- 🚀 Faster infrastructure provisioning
- 📦 Consistent application deployment
- 🔐 Reduced human error in operations

It eliminates manual configuration drift and ensures **environment consistency across Dev, QA, and Production**.
