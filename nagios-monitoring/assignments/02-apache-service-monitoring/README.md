# 📊 Assignment 2 – Apache2 Service Monitoring using Nagios

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Implemented service-level monitoring in Nagios to track the availability and health status of the **Apache2 web service** on a monitored host.

Configured Nagios to perform active service checks and generate real-time status updates, ensuring proactive detection of service downtime.

This assignment demonstrates practical implementation of application-layer monitoring.

## ⚙️ Implementation Summary

### 1️⃣ Apache Service Setup

- Installed Apache2 on monitored host  
- Verified web server functionality  
- Confirmed service running state  

Prepared the target service for monitoring validation.

---

### 2️⃣ Service Check Configuration

- Defined new service configuration in Nagios  
- Configured check command for HTTP/Apache  
- Associated service with target host  
- Updated configuration files  

Enabled Nagios to actively monitor Apache service status.

---

### 3️⃣ Configuration Validation

- Verified Nagios configuration integrity  
- Restarted Nagios services  
- Confirmed service registration  

Ensured error-free monitoring configuration.

---

### 4️⃣ Monitoring & Status Verification

- Accessed Nagios dashboard  
- Verified Apache service status as **OK**  
- Simulated service stop to test failure detection  
- Confirmed Nagios reported **CRITICAL/DOWN** state  

Successfully validated service-level monitoring behavior.
