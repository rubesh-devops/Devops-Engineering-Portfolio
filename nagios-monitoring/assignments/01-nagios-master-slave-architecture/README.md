# 📊 Assignment 1 – Nagios Master-Slave Monitoring Architecture

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Designed and implemented a **Nagios Master-Slave monitoring architecture** to monitor distributed infrastructure nodes.

Configured a centralized monitoring server (Nagios Master) and integrated two remote hosts (Slaves) for real-time health monitoring and alert tracking.

This setup reflects enterprise-grade infrastructure monitoring architecture.

---

## 🎯 Objective

✔ Deploy Nagios Master server  
✔ Configure remote host monitoring  
✔ Add two monitored slave nodes  
✔ Validate host availability status  
✔ Enable centralized infrastructure visibility  

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Summary

### 1️⃣ Nagios Master Deployment

- Installed Nagios Core on Master node  
- Configured required dependencies and plugins  
- Enabled web interface for monitoring dashboard  
- Verified Nagios service status  

The Master server acts as the centralized monitoring controller.

---

### 2️⃣ Slave Host Configuration

- Prepared two remote Linux hosts  
- Installed NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor)  
- Configured communication between Master and Slaves  
- Opened required monitoring ports  

Enabled secure remote monitoring capability.

---

### 3️⃣ Host Integration into Nagios

- Defined host configuration files on Master  
- Added host definitions for Slave-1 and Slave-2  
- Configured service checks (Ping, SSH, HTTP, etc.)  
- Updated Nagios configuration files  

Integrated both hosts into centralized monitoring.

---

### 4️⃣ Validation & Monitoring Dashboard

- Restarted Nagios service  
- Verified host availability in dashboard  
- Confirmed service check status (UP/OK)  
- Validated successful Master-Slave communication  

Monitoring architecture successfully operational.
