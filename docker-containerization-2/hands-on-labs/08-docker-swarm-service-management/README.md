# 🐳 Hands-On – Creating and Managing Services in Docker Swarm

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Deployed and managed a **replicated service in Docker Swarm**, demonstrating distributed service orchestration across cluster nodes.

This hands-on focuses on Swarm service lifecycle management including creation, validation, and deletion.

---

## 🎯 Objective

✔ Create a Docker Swarm service  
✔ Deploy container replicas across cluster nodes  
✔ Validate running services  
✔ Remove services from cluster  

---

# 🏗 Implementation Summary

---

## 🔹 Step 1 – Creating a Swarm Service

- Defined a service within the Swarm cluster
- Specified container image
- Configured replication settings
- Allowed Swarm scheduler to distribute tasks across available nodes

### Outcome
Service successfully deployed across the cluster.

---

## 🔹 Step 2 – Validating Service Deployment

- Listed active services in the cluster
- Verified service status and replica count
- Confirmed task allocation across nodes

### Outcome
Cluster service successfully running with desired state maintained.

---

## 🔹 Step 3 – Service Removal

- Executed service removal operation
- Verified service deletion from cluster
- Confirmed cleanup of running tasks

### Outcome
Service lifecycle completed and cluster resources freed.
