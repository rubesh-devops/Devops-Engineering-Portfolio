# 🐳 Hands-On – Running a Sample Docker Compose Deployment

---

## 📌 Lab Overview

Deployed a **multi-container application environment** using Docker Compose to understand container orchestration using YAML-based configuration.

This hands-on demonstrates how multiple services can be defined, built, and executed together using a single declarative file.

---

## 🎯 Objective

✔ Create a Docker Compose project directory  
✔ Define multi-container configuration in YAML format  
✔ Build and deploy containers using Docker Compose  
✔ Verify successful container execution  

---

# 🏗 Implementation Summary

---

## 🔹 Step 1 – Project Structure Creation

- Created a dedicated project directory for Docker Compose
- Ensured clean and isolated deployment environment

### Outcome
Organized container orchestration workspace ready.

---

## 🔹 Step 2 – Writing Docker Compose Configuration

- Created `docker-compose.yml` file
- Defined services using YAML syntax
- Configured container images, ports, and runtime settings
- Established service definitions for multi-container setup

### Outcome
Infrastructure-as-Code configuration prepared for multi-service deployment.

---

## 🔹 Step 3 – Building and Deploying Services

- Executed Docker Compose build process
- Created containers based on YAML configuration
- Automatically handled service dependencies

### Outcome
Multiple containers deployed simultaneously using Compose.

---

## 🔹 Step 4 – Verifying Deployment

- Confirmed all defined services were running
- Validated container states and exposed ports
- Ensured service accessibility via browser/IP

### Outcome
Multi-container application environment successfully deployed.
